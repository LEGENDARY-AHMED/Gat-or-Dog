first if you did not want to install modules on your device create a viritual environment
to create a veritual environment (venv) use this command `python -m venv .venv`

the vs code will ask you to swicth to the venv press "yes" please

if you want to install modules in your device there is no need to create venv
just install dependences or modules to make project work

to install all modules in your device or in your venv you create
use this command `pip install -r Requirements.txt`
this command will install all modules used in project
